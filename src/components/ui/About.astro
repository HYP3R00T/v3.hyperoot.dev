    Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and
    tumbled head first into the rabbit hole of coding and web development.
    Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of building software for
    an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a digital product
    studio. My main <span class="text-white">building</span> focus these days is
    building accessible user interfaces for our customers at Klaviyo. I most enjoy
    building software in the sweet spot where design and engineering meet things
    that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I've
    also released an online video course <span class="text-white">building</span
    > that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with the Spotify
    API. When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually rock climbing
